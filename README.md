# Hi there, I'm Mellon Obada! üëã

Full Stack Developer | Building Products That Matter
I don't just write code, I solve problems that impact real users. Recently, I architected and deployed a school transport booking system that processes real-time geolocation data, serving hundreds of students and parents daily. That's the kind of work that excites me: practical, scalable solutions that people actually use.
What I Bring to Your Team
Technical Excellence

Full stack development with modern frameworks (React, Next.js, Node.js, Flask, FastApi, RESTful API)
Database architecture and optimization (PostgreSQL)
Cloud deployment and DevOps practices
Real-time systems and API integration
Clean, maintainable code that scales

Business Impact

I ship features that users love‚Äîmy transport system reduced booking times by 70%
I think product-first: every line of code should solve a real problem
I debug fast, communicate clearly, and meet deadlines

Current Focus

Deepening expertise in cloud architecture (AWS, Azure)
Mastering advanced React patterns and performance optimization
Contributing to open source projects that challenge me
